Building with Visual Studio:
* extract SDL to sopwith/sdl
* extract SDLNet to the same sopwith/sdl
* build the solution (x86 or x64)
* before running the executable, make sure to copy SDL2.dll and SDL2_net.dll to a place where the executable can find them

Confirmed working with VS 2019 and SDL2-2.0.14
